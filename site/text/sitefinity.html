            <p>A CMS, an abbreviation for Content Management System, is a software application that enables you to
                create websites and manage its different components such as web pages, text blocks, images, videos, etc.
                A CMS usually provides an easy-to-use interface that lets you:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create web pages
                </li>
                <li>Create page layouts and page templates
                </li>
                <li>Create, edit, and manage content such as blogs, articles, images, videos, etc
                </li>
                <li>Create custom content types (a content type is a sort of a template of properties from which you can
                    create new instances; for example, a ‘News’ content type may have properties such as title, body,
                    author, and date, while a news article, which is an instance of the ‘News’ content type, will have
                    specific values for each of these properties.)
                </li>

            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, a CMS will also have programming interfaces (APIs) that allow for an enormous amount of
                extensibility. For example, you may want data submitted through your website to be processed in a
                specific way by the CMS. In such cases, a software developer would use the CMS's programming interfaces
                to develop code to handle the data. For this reason, CMS's are usually built for a specific type of
                programming platform--Java, .NET, etc.
