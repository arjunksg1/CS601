            Sunday morning near a local pond. I am a software developer, writer, and instructional designer. I created
            this website as part of my coursework at Boston University.</p>

            complete a Master’s program in Software Development. The purpose of this website is to provide you with an
            overview of my professional skills and tell you a little bit about my hobbies and interests, which including
